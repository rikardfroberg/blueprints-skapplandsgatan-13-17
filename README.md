Blueprints of Skäpplandsgatan 13-17 and HTML files with links
# Background
BRF Skäpplandsgatan 13-17 is considering to publish blueprints of the appartments with supporting walls marked in red, so that members can check the blueprints for supporting walls before submitting a request for remodelling.

Any plans involving moving or modifying supporting walls would off course automatically be denied and the publishing of the blueprints could help preempting such requests.

Published here as HTML so that the board can review the colored versions of the blueprints before publication.

Disclaimer: The colored blueprints found here are not reviewed and accepted by the board. This is a draft version and should not be taken as any foundation for remodelling plans.
